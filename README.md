# Section 1: Java Spring Boot


* 1. What is Spring Boot? How is it different from other Spring frameworks?
Spring Boot is a popular Java-based open-source framework that is used for building standalone, production-ready applications. It is built on top of the Spring framework and provides a simplified way to configure and deploy Spring-based applications.

The main difference between Spring Boot and other Spring frameworks is that Spring Boot aims to simplify the process of creating Spring-based applications by providing a set of pre-configured dependencies and settings. This means that developers can quickly build and deploy production-ready applications without having to spend a lot of time configuring the application environment.
